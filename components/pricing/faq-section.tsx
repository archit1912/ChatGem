    question: "How does the token system work?",
    answer:
      "Each message you send to the AI costs 1 token. When you purchase the Pro Plan for â‚¹100, you get 1000 tokens, which means 1000 messages. Tokens don't expire and you can use them at your own pace.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I run out of free messages?",
    answer:
      "Free users get 10 messages per day that reset every 24 hours. Once you've used your daily limit, you'll need to wait for the reset or purchase tokens to continue chatting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with your purchase, contact our support team within 7 days for a full refund.",

    question: "Is my data secure and private?",

    question: "Can I use ChatBot AI for commercial purposes?",

  },
  {
    question: "Do tokens expire?",
    answer:
      "No, tokens never expire. Once you purchase tokens, you can use them whenever you want, at your own pace. There's no time limit or monthly commitment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
    answer:
      "You can purchase additional tokens anytime. Since we use a pay-per-use model rather than subscriptions, you have complete flexibility in how much you spend.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, UPI, net banking, and digital wallets through our secure payment partner Razorpay. All payments are processed securely.",
